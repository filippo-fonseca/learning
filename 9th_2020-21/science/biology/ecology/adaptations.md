# Adaptations

## Types of Adaptations

**Anatomical/Norphological (Structural) Adaptations:** Changes involving a physical aspect of an organism.

Deals with structure and form.

EX: developing wings for flight, fins for swimming, or powerful legs for jumping

_Types_: Camouflage - a primary defense against predators to avoid detection

Mimicry - Similarity of one organism (the mimic) to another (the model) that enhances the mimic's fitness through its effect on the behavior of a third party (the operator)

Types of beaks/legs - Differnet types allow for filtering, probing, tearing meat, drilling holes, catching insects, etc.

**Ethological (Bahavioral) Adaptations:** Change affecting the way an organism naturally acts.

Usually with a focus on behavior under natural conditions, and viewing behavior as an evolutionary natural trait.

_Types_: Migration - The large-scale movement of members of a species to a different environment.

Courtship - Behavior that results in mating and eventual reproduction.

**Physiological:** Similar to structural adaptations in the sense that they involbe a physical cange to the species.

Refer to the metabolic of physiologic adjustment within the cells/tissue/composition of an organism.

Not always seen in the organism's appearance.

_Types_: Hibernation - a state of greatly reduced metabolic activity.

Estivation - a state of animal dormancy, similar to hibernation, although taking place in the summer rather than the winter.

- Enables animals to survive extreme heat, drought, or lack of food

- Equivalent to hibernation, but in a hot climate (usually summer)
- Usually done by amphibians, snails, crocodiles, etc.

### How do Abiotic Factors Influence Adaptations?

- Your environment is made up of abiotic (non-living) factors
  - Can become limiting to the organisms in an environment -> This is why adaptations are _key_ to prigress and survival as a species.
  - Organisms must be able to interact/tolerate/exploit the abiotic factors in a given ecosystem

**Examples**:

- Water
- Light
- Wind
- Temperature
- pH
- Salinity
- Nutrients

### Categories

**Promote Survival**:

- Water
- High light

**Limit Survival**:

- Extreme temperature
- Low light

For example, a cactus has no legs/leaves,
as there is not much water to absorb.
A plant in the rainforest, on the other hand,
will have larger legs and leaves in order to
make the most of the water-based ecosystems.

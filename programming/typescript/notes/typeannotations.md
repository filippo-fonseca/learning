# ðŸ”” Section 3: Type Annotations

## 14. Type Annotations and Inference

### Definitions

**Type Annotations:** Code we add to tell TypeScript what type of value a variable will refer to (we devs tell TS the type)

**Type Inference:** TypeScript tries to figure out what type of value a variable refers to (TS guesses the type)

## 15. Annotations with Variables

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

```ts
const apples: number = 5;
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** In the code snippet above, our type annotation is the `: number =` part of the variable declaration.

This tells TS that the variable `apples` will only ever have a value of a `number`.

Another example could be with built in objects (instance of a class):

```ts
// built in objects
let now: Date = new Date();
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** Here, we are defining a variable called `now` and we are telling TS that the variable is going to be of type `Date`. On the other side, we assign it an instance of a `Date` object.

## 16. Object Literal Annotations

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

Let's take a look at an example of defining a type annotation for an Array:

```ts
// Array
let colors: string[] = ["red", "green", "blue"];
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** In the variable declaration above, it's important to note that the annotation (`string[]`) doesn't actually create an array. It just tells TS that the string will contain the value of an array.

We can see the same thing happen with other types of values:

```ts
let myNumbers: number[] = [1, 2, 3];
let truths: boolean[] = [true, true, false];
```

With **classes**, type annotations look like this:

```ts
// Classes
class Car {}
let car: Car = new Car();
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** Here, we are defining a class named `Car` and declaring a variable named `car` that that takes in a type of `Car` and creates an instance of class `Car`.

With **objects**, type annotations would look like this:

```ts
// Object Literal
let point: { x: number; y: number } = {
  x: 10,
  y: 20,
};
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:** Here, we are defining an object named `point` that has two values, `x` and `y`. In the type annotation, we are telling TypeScript that the values of `x` and `y` can only ever be numbers, as evidenced above.

### 17. Annotations Around Functions

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

**Example:**

```ts
// Function
const logNumber: (i: number) => void = (i: number) => {
  console.log(i);
};
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:**

- We are declaring an arrow function called `logNumber` with the `const` keyword
- The portion of the arrow function on the left side of the equals sign and after the colon is the type annotation
- We are telling TS that the argument `i` will be of type `number`
- After that, we are telling TS that the output will result in `void`
- On the right-hand side of the equals sign is the actual argument of the function `logNumber,`i`, which in this case has been given a type of`number`
- After that, we are logging `i` (the function's argument), to the console

## 18. Understanding Inference

**Variable Declaration**: `const color =`
**Variable Initialization**: "red";

- If on the same line, TS can still decupher the Type of the variable

## When do we actually need Type annotations or Type inference?

**Inference:**: Always!

## 19. The 'Any' Type

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

```ts
// When to use annotations
// 1) Function that returns the 'any' type
const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
const coordinates = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates); // {x: 10, y: 20};
```

- Here, we are defining a variable with `const` called `json` that contains a string
- The `coordinates` variable takes the string and parses it with `JSON.parse()`
- Then, we log `coordinates` to the console with the final line of code

**'Any' Type**: TypeScript has no clue what this is - can't check for correct property references

- **AVOID VARIABLES WITH 'ANY' AT ALL COSTS**
- TS cannot help us catch errors

## 20. Fixing the 'Any' Type

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

- Add in type annotations to the `coordinates` declaration, as such:

```ts
const json = '{"x": 10, "y": 20}';
const coordinates: { x: number; y: number } = JSON.parse(json);
console.log(coordinates); // {x: 10, y: 20};
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION:**

- We added the code snippet `{ x: number; y: number }` to specify to TS the what type each parameter is going to have

## 21. Delayed Initialization

When we are declaring a value on one line and then calling it on another, this is known as `Delayed Initialization`. We can prevent the value from being of type 'Any' by using Type Annotation:

```ts
// 2) When we declare a variable on one line
// and initialize it later
let words = ["red", "green", "blue"];
let foundWord: boolean;

for (let i = 0; i < words.length; i++) {
  if (words[i] === "green") {
    foundWord = true;
  }
}
```

## 22. When Inference Doesn't Work

- Refer to features/annotations/variables.ts

In the following snippet:

```ts
// 3) Variable whose type cannot be inferred correctly
let numbers = [-10, -1, -12];
let numberAboveZero = false;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] > 0) {
    numberAboveZero = numbers[i];
  }
}
```

**CODE DECONSTRUCTION**:

- We are defining two variables with `let`: `numbers` and `numberAboveZero`.
- Below, we are creating a for loop that checks if there is a number greater than 0 in the `numbers` array.
  The `if` statement inside of the for loop will return an error, as we are assigning `numberAboveZero` (currently just a boolean) to a number.
- We can fix this using type annotations and making the type of `numberAboveZero` both a `boolean` and a `number`, as such:

```ts
// 3) Variable whose type cannot be inferred correctly
let numbers = [-10, -1, -12];
let numberAboveZero: boolean | number = false;

for (let i = 0; i < numbers.length; i++) {
  if (numbers[i] > 0) {
    numberAboveZero = numbers[i];
  }
}
```

# Types of Data

## Major Types

1. Numerical
2. Categorical
3. Ordinal

### Numerical

Represents a quantifiable measurement.

- Heights of people, page load times, stock prices, etc.

There are two main kinds of numerival data:

**Discrete Data:**

Integer-based; often counts some sort of event.

- How many purchases did a customer make in a year?
- How many times did I flip "heads"?

**Continous Data:**

Has an infinite number of possible values.

- How much time did it take for a user to check out?
- How much rain feel on a given day?

### Categorical

Qualitative data that has no inherent _mathematical_ meaning.

- Gender, Yes/no (binary data), Race, State of Residence, Product Category, Political Party, etc.

You can assign numbers to categorie sin order to represent them in a more compact manner, but the numbers don't have any mathematical meaning.

**Ex:** Texas is greater than Florida based on population.

## Ordinal

A mixture of numerical and categorical data types

Categorical data that has mathematical meaning.

**Ex:** Movie ratings on a 1-5 scale

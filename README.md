# Filippo Fonseca's Software Engineering Learning Material

This is all of the learning material, projects, notes, and docs that have aided me in becoming a Full-Stack Engineer. They continue to help me to this day and I still commit changes to it pretty much on the daily; always learning and growing! 💪

Feel free to take it and use it to help you understand the wonderful world of programming just a little bit better. :)

# Filippo Fonseca's Software Engineering Learning Material

This is all of the learning material, projects, notes, and docs that have aided me in becoming an Entrepreneur, Full-Stack Engineer, Data Scientist, Designer, Podcaster, and more. They continue to help me to this day, as I still commit changes to it pretty much on the daily; always learning and growing! 💪

Feel free to take the notes & projects and use them to help you understand our wonderful world just a little bit better. :)

Hope it helps in some way, shape, or form.
